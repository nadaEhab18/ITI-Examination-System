# ITI Examination System Database

## üìò Project Overview

The **ITI Examination System Database** is designed to manage and automate the process of creating, conducting, and evaluating exams for educational institutions. The system provides a centralized platform for managing courses, instructors, students, and examinations, ensuring data integrity, security, and efficiency.

## üéØ Objectives

* Provide a **question pool** with multiple question types (MCQ, True/False, Text).
* Enable instructors to **create exams** by selecting questions manually or randomly.
* Allow the system to **auto-grade** objective questions and support manual grading for text answers.
* Facilitate **role-based access** for administrators, training managers, instructors, and students.
* Automate **exam scheduling**, **student access**, and **result calculation**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Features

### 1. **Question Pool Management**

* Supports Multiple Choice, True/False, and Text questions.
* Stores correct answers for auto-grading.
* Supports regular expressions for validating text answers.

### 2. **Course & User Management**

* Stores data for courses, instructors, and students.
* Each instructor can teach one or more courses.
* Managed by a **Training Manager**, who can add/edit branches, tracks, and intakes.

### 3. **Exam Creation & Execution**

* Instructors create exams by selecting questions manually or randomly.
* Ensures exam total marks do not exceed the course‚Äôs maximum degree.
* Defines exam metadata: type, intake, branch, track, course, start/end time, and duration.
* Students can take exams only within the defined time window.

### 4. **Result Management**

* Stores student answers.
* Auto-calculates grades for objective questions.
* Displays results for manual grading of text questions.

### 5. **User Roles & Permissions**

* **Admin:** Manages the system structure and user permissions.
* **Training Manager:** Handles branches, tracks, intakes, and student records.
* **Instructor:** Creates exams and reviews results.
* **Student:** Takes exams and views results.

### 6. **Backup & Security**

* Implements **daily automatic database backups**.
* Enforces **data integrity** using constraints, triggers, and permissions.
